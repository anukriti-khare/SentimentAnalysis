This project focuses on building a high-performance sentiment analysis model using a large-scale Twitter dataset containing 1.6 million tweets labeled as either positive or negative. The goal was to preprocess real-world social media text data and classify tweet sentiments using traditional machine learning techniques. The dataset underwent rigorous cleaning including stopword removal, lemmatization, and lowercasing. Features were extracted using the TF-IDF vectorization method, incorporating both unigrams and bigrams for richer representation.

After feature extraction, multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Linear SVM, using stratified train-test splitting. Among the models, Logistic Regression with TF-IDF bigrams performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 79.4%. Detailed evaluation using confusion matrices and classification reports is included for comparison.

To make the project more interactive and accessible, a Streamlit web application was developed that allows users to input any text and get real-time sentiment predictions. The app is lightweight, fast, and replicates the final model's behavior. This project demonstrates end-to-end implementation — from preprocessing and modeling to evaluation and deployment — using interpretable and scalable ML tools.
